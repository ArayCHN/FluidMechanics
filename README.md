### Course Project, 2017fall Exchange Program @ UC Berkeley

This repo contains two MATLAB projects that solves two problems in Fluid Mechanics.

Project1_V2.pdf describes the first project, which explores the fundamentals of streamline, streakline and pathline. It uses numerical method for differential equation solutions.
