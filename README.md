## Fluid Mechanics
### Course Project, 2017fall Exchange Program @ UC Berkeley

This repo contains two MATLAB projects that solves two problems in Fluid Mechanics.

Project1_V2.pdf describes the first project, which explores the fundamentals of streamline, streakline and pathline. It uses numerical method for differential equation solutions.

Project 2 is under the folder /project2-NavierStokes. This project explores the fundamentals of a classical problem, [**the Stokes second problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_problem). Many materials found online, including wikipedia and [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-25-advanced-fluid-mechanics-fall-2013/more-complex-viscous-dominated-flows/MIT2_25F13_SolutionStokes2.pdf), are incomplete as to their descriptions, and the report of this project derives the solution for the problem in detail, in the hope that this will be of some help to future learners.

**The Stokes second problem** states that there is an infinitely large plate that oscillates in a pattern $v = U_0 cos\omega t$. It then asks for the velocity at a certain time $t$ and a coordinate $y$. This is a nonlinear partial-differential equation at first sight, but can be simplified and found a close-form solution for. See [this file](https://github.com/ArayCHN/FluidMechanics/blob/master/project2-NavierStokes/Write_up/report.pdf) for solution.
